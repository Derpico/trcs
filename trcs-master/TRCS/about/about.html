            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>Welcome to "The Real Cory Sanders" webpage. I built this site from scratch specifically as a hub to connect anything and everything I create or collaborate on. Although not perfect, I wanted to put out my own site so people could connect with me and maybe share their journey as well. I will be adding to, enhancing, and upgrading my site as I learn more but for now, this is my best foot forward. Below are some links to some projects I've worked on plus some of the websites I use for reference. These resources are beyond helpful so feel free to check these out by clicking on the icon!</p>

        <div class="call-outs-container">
            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p>I love to create music! I listen to almost everything, but I love the Rock and Metal genres the most. Here are a few songs I have on my Soundcloud. Give a thumbs up if you like it!</p> 
                <div class="call-out-img">

            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>Projects</h4>
                <p>If you haven't used Codepen yet, I highly recommend it! It's a free "wysiwyg" (what you see is what you get) code editor for html, css, and JS. I like to post projects I've been working on here as well.</p>
                <div class="call-out-img">
                    <a href="https://codepen.io/Derpico/" target="_blank">

            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>Github</h4>
                <p>I'm still learning the proper way to use Github but I have found it extremely useful for storing projects so I can access them later from anywhere I may be. </p>
                <div class="call-out-img">
                    <a href="https://github.com/Derpico" target="_blank">

        <div class="call-outs-container">
            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>W3 Schools</h4>
                <p>I probably use this site more than any other for reference. It is a vast library of HTML, CSS, and JS tutorials. They offer lessons and even have website templates you can use to build a site of your own.</p>
                <div class="call-out-img">
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
                        <img src="../img/w3schools.png" alt="Soundcloud">
                    </a>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>CSS Tricks</h4>
                <p>CSS Tricks is another helpful site that gives full, easy to understand tutorials on various CSS topics. This one should also be in your bookmarks.</p>
                <div class="call-out-img">
                    <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">
                        <img src="../img/css-tricks.png" alt="Soundcloud">
                    </a>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>MDN Web Docs</h4>
                <p>Like W3 Schools, the Mozilla Developer Network is an immense library should you require any reference. MDN Web Docs covers a wider variety of topics, however ranging from F.E.D. to game development.</p>
                <div class="call-out-img">
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">

        <div class="call-outs-container">
            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>Codecademy</h4>
                <p>A great learning site if you are wanting to take some free classes. The lessons are just challenging enough with an emphasis on looking for the answers yourself, which you will be doing a lot of as a coder.</p>
                <div class="call-out-img">
                    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">
                        <img src="../img/codecademy.jpg" alt="Soundcloud">

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>freeCodeCamp</h4>
                <p>The material is presented in a slightly different format but the lessons don't require as much research to solve, like in Codecademy, while still maintaining a challenge.</p>
                <div class="call-out-img">
                    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">
                        <img src="../img/fcc.png" alt="Soundcloud">

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="call-out">
                <h4>Treehouse</h4>
                <p>Treehouse is a paid service but I find the lessons more to my speed of learning as well as affordable. The lessons are setup like a classroom with an instructor, teacher's notes, quizzes, and practice lessons to reenforce what you just learned. They also provide a built-in text editor so you can follow right along! </p>
