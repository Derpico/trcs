				<h1>Pursuing A Tech Career At 36...</h1>

			<div class="flex-main_content">
				<p>So here I am at 36 years old pursuing a career in tech. What took me so long? What was I doing before this? I’m glad you asked! I come from the generation that got to watch as computers became standard use in classrooms as I went through grade school. My first memories of using computers were playing Oregon Trail and other various games at the time. From that point on, I have always had a special place in my heart for computers and, especially, computer games.
				<p>
					My family wasn’t the most well off, so I didn’t have access to technology like most people do now. We had one computer that my parents bought that I managed to completely foul up due to me “exploring”. Thank goodness I had a friend who was tech savvy that could fix my mess! I tried to learn how to program computers through a book I found at the school library. Honestly, at the age I was, it all seemed way above my mental capacity, so I opted for something a bit more achievable in the form of band class.
				</p>
				<p>
					I took to music quite well. I learned to play trumpet for a few years and eventually picked up guitar. Once I learned to play my first song, I was hooked! After a few months, I could play some songs by ear. I ended up playing in a band with friends through high school and played in various groups after that through the years. I was convinced that music was my one and only future, so I put all my time and effort into it. It wasn’t until about the age of 30 that I started to feel a small dissatisfaction from the progress I was making in my career choice. I had practiced hours upon endless hours and played gig after gig to bring my dream to fruition. It never came.
					So, what was I supposed to do? Leaving behind the only thing I felt I was ever good at left me depressed and bitter. There I was at age 34 with nothing to really show for 18 years of dedication. I didn’t really make any attempts to try anything else for a while because I had never been in the position I was before. I had to do a fair amount of searching and coming to the reality that what I was chasing wasn’t ever going to be caught by me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, I snapped out of the haze and decided that if I was going to get involved with something, it might as well be a career in tech. I didn’t know what I was going to do yet, but I had always wanted to learn how to program. I scoured the internet searching for a good place to start. I read book after book on python, C++, and JavaScript, before I decided to give front-end web development a try. 
					From the very first lessons, I was able to grasp html and css with ease. Being able to learn so quickly was exciting and made me think that there might be something to this. JavaScript has proven to be a challenge, but I find that I am able to understand the concepts with a bit of study. After all, if it were too easy, I would get bored and stop learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s only been 4 months since I started studying, but I can already build simple websites from scratch. I do my absolute best to set aside at least an hour or two each day to dedicate to learning code. I take notes on every new concept I learn and if I don’t understand something, I have the entire internet at my fingertips. I am feeling a renewed since of purpose in my life as I travel down this path, and what a relief that is! Second chances are very real and that sometimes there are more paths than we realize. The world is a big place, life is long, and there are things to do in it. I am excited for the future and pleased to be walking the path I am on.
